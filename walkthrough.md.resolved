# Electric Load Forecasting Walkthrough

I have implemented a complete electric load forecasting pipeline in Python. The system processes raw load data, weather factors, and holiday events to train a cost-aware Random Forest model.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration**: Merged load, weather, and event data using precise datetime alignment.
- **Feature Engineering**: Implemented seasonal features (hour, day, month) and critical lag features (1-step, 1-day, 1-week lags and rolling means).
- **Time-Based Validation**: Used 2020-01-01 as the cutoff to ensure realistic model evaluation.
- **Cost-Aware Optimization**: Applied an asymmetric penalty function (4x underforecast vs 2x overforecast) and optimized the forecast with a 2% upward shift.

## Execution Results

The script was executed successfully. Here are the observed metrics:

### Initial Model Performance
- **Total Penalty**: 3,924,960.00
- **Peak Penalty**: 687,314.00
- **Off-Peak Penalty**: 3,237,646.00
- **Bias**: -0.06%
- **P95 Absolute Deviation**: 136.19

### Optimization Result
- **Total Adjusted Penalty**: 4,931,997.51
- **Optimization Outcome**: The 2% adjustment was tested against the asymmetric penalty. In this specific run, the adjustment increased the total penalty by 1,007,037.51, suggesting that the base model's bias was already well-centered for the given data, or a smaller adjustment is needed for this specific test period.
